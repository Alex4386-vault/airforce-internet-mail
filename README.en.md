**Aug 9th, 2021 ~ Oct 9th, 2021(estimated)**  
This issue thread is for sending messages to Alex4386 during military service period!  

## Hey, This guy is "serving" military
Wut, You wanna contact me?  
Oh, snap! I can not access the internet in any way during training period. ~~(Because "Those **SHOULD BE OBEYED AND CONTROLLED**")~~  
What a terrible fate. Isn't it? Don't worry, You can still write a Internet mail! (Me: I don't care just give me my phone. Gov: STFU!)  

*Note: I still can NOT reply to your message. But I can probably check your messages.*  

## Write a message
Just write your message on issues.  
Your message should be **LESS THAN 2000 BYTES and PLAIN TEXT ONLY**. or it won't be sent.

If your issue is closed, then that means the message probably has sent.  
**Additional Information: I can NOT retrieve messages until Aug 23rd (Training Week 2) or Aug 30th (Training Week 3)** due to COVID Restrictions and "Policy".  

## WHY GitHub?
South Korean Airforce Internet Mail System SUUUUUUUUUCKS.  
You don't want to use Internet Explorer. Don't you. (If you didn't know, IE is a **contemporary browser** for **browsing government services** _(also, obsolete ones usually means no support for ActiveX. those includes "Netscape Navigator" and "Mosaic")_)
